Filled with dread and paralyzed by anxiety, she wished she could be carefree like the other students in the cacophonous gymnasium. The polyethylene bleachers were packed with the entire college freshman class. All around the bleachers, robotic animals buzzed, growled, and roared, while observing the students. Kaia leaned in to her best friend Sata and whispered in her ear. “Let’s run.” Sata shook her head vigorously, but her thick mane of reddish brown hair barely moved. “We wouldn’t even make it to the door, which is locked by the way.” Kaia tucked her hair behind her ears and leaned in further. “If we run, they’d have to knock us out, and we’d miss the ceremony.” Sata gestured towards the walls of the gymnasium. “If the BuzzBees knocked us out, the WakeupWasps would sting us until we were awake.” The gymnasium walls were covered with trypophobia-inducing hexagonal holes. Inside the walls, there was a network of tunnels filled with robotic insects always ready to swarm anyone who stepped out of line. Kaia gently tugged on Sata’s shirt sleeve. “Maybe if we act crazy, they’d knock us out to keep us from disrupting the ceremony.” Sata was wearing her favorite pink shirt. The shirt had a design featuring voluptuous manga catgirls1 hanging with nooses around their necks while vomiting rainbows. “Acting crazy should be easy for you, because you’ve always been insane.” Sata ruffled Kaia’s hair, knowing full well that it made Kaia mad. Unlike Sata, Kaia meticulously straightened her hair and brushed it obsessively. Kaia smoothed her hair and adjusted her hair clips. Each hair clip was decorated with a dead mouse design. The mice were sticking out their tongues and had X’s for eyes. Sata could see that her joke had not landed well, so she tried to reassure her friend. “Maybe it won’t be so bad. Maybe I won’t have a seizure and you won’t freak out.” Kaia tilted her head and struck a kawaii2 pose. “Awww, you always know exactly what to say to keep me from freaking out. Have you ever thought of becoming a motivational speaker?” Kaia’s facial features were tiny, but her eyes and forehead were large. Kaia knew that her small face and stature made her look much younger than she was, and she often acted sweet and innocent to hide her sarcasm. Sata smiled and put her arm around Kaia, pretending to put her into a headlock. Kaia feigned distress while trying to wrestle free, but before long her head was resting on Sata’s shoulder and the two girls embraced. Kaia pressed her cheek against the rainbow vomit that flowed down Sata’s shirt sleeves in lines as straight as Kaia’s hair. Sata looked over at Kaia and enjoyed coloristic contrast between Kaia’s hair and the rainbow vomit. Kaia had purple hair which was so muted that it was almost grey. Her hair sent the mixed message of wanting to blend in and being desperate for attention. Several students noticed that Kaia and Sata were hugging. They moved closer and started to jeer. “Get a room, you two!” “Looks like the sexual tension was too much for them!” “Which one is butch? And what do you call the other one?” Kaia wondered if she was imagining the jeers until she felt Sata tense up and eventually withdraw from their embrace. For as long as she could remember, Kaia had auditory hallucinations. She sometimes had trouble differentiating between the voices of people around her and the voices in her head. Some voices are easier to differentiate than others. You’re the only voice that narrates everything that happens to me, Kaia thought, proving that she was totally nuts by responding to an auditory hallucination. To make matters worse, Kaia often had strange dreams at night and weird visions during the day. The dreams and visions seemed so real and familiar that it sometimes took Kaia a long time to reacclimatize to reality. Kaia looked down at her shirt. Her shirt was white with a design of a dead mouse surrounded by snow. She liked the dead mouse designs on her hair clips and shirt, because they made her sad but in a good way. Kaia pulled on her shirt subconsciously. When the shirt moved, it looked like the snow was falling and the mouse was in its death throes. The jeering eventually subsided, but Kaia and Sata remained apart, sitting quietly. The college Provost walked up to the podium in front of the bleachers. Suddenly, the gymnasium fell quiet. Even the robotic animals were silent as the Provost cleared his throat and prepared to speak. Already sweating, the portly Provost wiped his brow with a lace handkerchief he retrieved from the pocket of his blazer. With three clicks of his tongue, the Provost summoned three robotic bees. The BuzzBees landed on the Provost’s face and neck and used their stingers to administer the pharmacological assistance that the Provost would need to assemble his frayed nerves. “Today we welcome a new cohort of-” A student with blue-green hair jumped on top of her seat on the bleachers and began to shout into a hand-held gigaphone. The sound was deafeningly loud. “Corporeal punishment is barbaric and ineffective! TaserTutors are torture! Reform the education system!” A ChaseChimpanzee jumped down from the rafters and tackled the student, knocking the gigaphone out of her hand. The protester was up in an instant, and began to punch and kick the ChaseChimpanzee. The ChaseChimpanzee struck back, but the protester seemed to holding her own, until a GuardGorilla knocked her to the ground. Even on the ground, the protester continued kicking and punching the SecuritySimians. The GuardGorilla scooped up the protester, pinning her arms at the sides. As she was carried out of the gymnasium, the protester flailed her legs and shouted political slogans. Visibly shaken, the Provost repeated his pre-speech ritual by clearing his throat again and clicking his tongue three more times. The three additional robotic bee stings successfully calmed the Provost, but when he resumed his speech, he was swaying side to side, gripping the podium for support, and having difficulty speaking clearly. “Dishipline and respet for aufority are eshenshial for a funshioning shosh-” The principal suddenly lurched forward and vomited all over the podium. Wiping his mouth with the sleeve of his blazer, the Provost wrapped up his speech. “Let the sheremony begin!” An automated voice started calling students to participate in the initiation ceremony. The gymnasium erupted with the excited chatter of the students and the sounds of the robotic wildlife. Kaia leaned in to whisper to Sata again, but stopped when she noticed that her friend was having a seizure. Sata’s expressionless face moved ever so slightly as she blankly stared into the distance. When she realized that the seizure was relatively mild and that Sata would recover shortly, Kaia let out a sigh of relief. While waiting for her friend to recover, Kaia held Sata’s hands, which unfortunately attracted the attention of nearby students. “I think she’s about to propose!” “Is that even legal?” “The SecuritySimians should arrest those two!” After seeing it countless times, Kaia knew exactly what to expect. As the seizure ended, Sata looked around disoriented and confused. The part that always broke Kaia’s heart was when Sata looked embarrassed about having a seizure. Sata pulled her hands away. Never knowing what to say, Kaia tried to start a conversation. “What do you think will happen to the protester?” “She’s going to get kicked out of college.” “How do you know?” “She didn’t go through the initiation rite.” “Maybe we can protest too?” Clearly not in the mood to continue the conversation, Sata did not reply. Sata was nervous about their first day of college. Neither of them ever fit in at school. Thinking about her friendship with Sata, Kaia wondered if the only reason that they were friends was because they were both abnormal. Would they still be friends if Sata was not epileptic? Or would Sata prefer to spend time with friends who did not hear and see things that were not there? How could Kaia possibly compete with friends that were normal? That’s mean, Kaia thought, criticizing her own internal monologue. I know you get to choose what to narrate, so I’d appreciate it if you could skip the super insecure thoughts. No way, Kaia, your insecurities are central to your story. When I was a little kid, you used to talk to me and help me all the time. Why are you such a jerk now? Kaia asked, assuming incorrectly that the narrator in her head was Ryt, the imaginary friend Kaia remembered from her childhood. If you’re not Ryt, then who are you? Kaia demanded futilely. If you don’t at least tell me your name, I’m going to spend the rest of my life in quiet meditation and you won’t have anything to narrate. Kaia’s empty threat to boycott her own life was especially useless given that her name had just been called. Realizing that it was her turn to participate in the initiation rite, Kaia froze in panic. Sata nudged Kaia and gestured for her to stand up. Desperate for a means of escape, Kaia looked pleadingly at Sata. Trying her best to be reassuring, Sata smiled weakly and gave Kaia a gesture of encouragement. Left with no other option, Kaia got up and started to squeeze through the rows of students. Kaia could feel the eyes of the students and robotic animals follow her to the TaserTutor next to the podium in front of the bleachers. The TaserTutor looked like a metal altar covered with a silvery hair. As she approached, the metallic wires covering the TaserTutor began to writhe. The TaserTutor shrunk down to match Kaia’s height. Robotic birds, bats, and bugs flew in circles above Kaia. A wall of HistorianHummingbirds hovered in front of her face, recording her every move from multiple angles, staring at her with their piercing eyes, relaying everything they saw to the display system on the walls of the gymnasium. When Kaia placed her palms down on the TaserTutor, metallic tendrils extended from the TaserTutor and wrapped around her arms up to the shoulders like vines around a tree. The automated voice that had called Kaia’s name earlier began to deliver commands. “State your full name.” “Kaiakelaaila Erkadia.” “State your age in years.” “18.” “List the three branches of Government.” “The CorporateCouncil, the DemocraticDelegation, and the EternalEnlightened.” So far so good, but the next questions would be much more difficult. “Given an average distance of 382 megameters, calculate the time in seconds required for a radio transmission to go from the surface of Earth to its moon and back.” Kaia thought about the task while typing it out using the virtual keyboard on the TaserTutor. Distance: 382 megameters. Speed of light: 300 megameters per second. Time: 382 / 300 seconds = 1.27 seconds Kaia opened her mouth to answer, but froze in horror. And back! Kaia said to herself. From Earth to the moon AND BACK! Terrified at the thought that she almost answered incorrectly, Kaia did the final calculation in her head. “2.54 seconds!” Kaia braced for an electric shock, but was relieved to hear the next task instead. “Given a distance range of 590 to 980 gigameters, calculate the minimum time in minutes required for a radio transmission to go from the surface of Earth to Jupiter.” Kaia’s head was spinning. She pushed through the vertigo and began to dissect the task. No ‘and back’ this time. ‘Minimum’ means 590 gigameters. Distance: 590 gigameters Speed of light: 18 gigameters per minute Time: 590 / 18 seconds … “32.78 minutes.” The pressure was getting to Kaia. She loved math, but hated solving word problems under threat of electric shock while everyone was watching. Luckily, the next task was related to geology. “Which mineral group is the most abundant in Earth’s crust and what are its three endmembers? “The feldspars are the most abundant. The endmembers are potassium feldspar, albite, and anorthite.” “Construct a representation of the chemical structure of any feldspar.” The display on the TaserTutor transformed from a keyboard into the periodic chart of elements. On top of each square on the chart was a sphere that represented an element. Kaia took a deep breathe. Chemistry was one of her favorite subjects. All she had to do was stay focused. Kaia used the display to enter the number of atoms of each she would need. Each time she entered a number, a new set of spheres appeared in front of her. In total, Kaia had 4 potassium atoms, 4 aluminum atoms, 12 silicon atoms, and 42 oxygen atoms. Kaia began arranging the spheres. The metallic tendrils extending from the TaserTutor stretched as she moved her hands from sphere to sphere. First, Kaia arranged 4 oxygen atoms into a tiny pyramid. Next, Kaia made a ring of 4 pyramids by adding 8 more oxygen atoms, 3 for each new pyramid except the last one, which only needed 2. Another 10 oxygen atoms were enough to make another identical ring that was connected to the first ring by two oxygen atoms. Then, Kaia used the last 20 oxygen atoms to create another identical pair of rings beneath the first. After creating the 4 rings of pyramids, Kaia put an aluminum or silicon atom in the middle of each of the 16 pyramids. Finally, Kaia put a potassium atom below the structure, another one below, and the final two potassium atoms in opposites corners of the middle of the structure. “This is the chemical structure of the basic subunit of potassium feldspar with ten additional oxygen atoms to completely surround each aluminum and silicon atom.” Kaia was out of breath and sweating. Her arms felt like they were made of feldspar. She was so exhausted that she almost did not care if she answered correctly or not. The pressure was getting to her. It had not occurred to Kaia that it would have been sufficient to create a single ring of pyramids and stick a potassium next to it. Stop it, you’re distracting me! Kaia thought, casting serious doubt on the durability of her mental state. “Describe the mineral composition of the Martian crust.” “The crust of Mars includes volcanic rock minerals such as feldspars, pyroxenes, and olivine.” “Explain the origin of nanomaterials on the surface of Mars. “The nanostructures originate from the two sources: the ancient Martian civilization-” Kaia stopped mid-sentence. She felt like her mouth was filled with Martian dust. A pulsing red light warned Kaia that pauses were not allowed. “-and Thelusian spacecrafts that collided with Mars during the Martian-Thelusian War.” Kaia looked up. The sky, once dark with orbiting spacecrafts, lit up as the entire Thelusian armada began to enter the thin Martian atmosphere. “Describe how the leader of each branch of government are selected.” People all around Kaia began to run for cover, but she knew there was nowhere to hide. Everyone was running and screaming except for her and Sata. What is Sata doing here on Mars? Kaia wondered. With an alarmed and desperate look on her face, Sata pointed down in front of Kaia. Unsure why Sata was pointing down and not up at impending cataclysm in the sky, Kaia turned her gaze down toward the pulsing red light emanating from the metallic table. Kaia, you know this. Everyone knows this. The CorporateCouncil is led by the person with the highest net worth. The leader of the DemocraticDelegation is the person with the highest number of social media followers. The EternalEnlightened vote to determine their own leader. Kaia opened her mouth, but instead of words, dust poured out. She tried to type out the answer, but the console quickly became covered in dust. The red light pulsed faster and faster until it became continuous. Kaia had run out of time. Her body shook with electricity. The TaserTutor mercilessly continued on to the next task. “Given that the Venusian orbital period is 225 days, calculate how many days would pass before Earth and Venus would return to their current positions.” Come on, Kaia, snap out of it. You eat harder tasks than this for breakfast. The least common multiple of the orbital periods is their product divided by their greatest common denominator. Just say or write 45 * 365 = 16425! Kaia was having trouble maintain her footing. Beneath her feet, countless skeletons were crumbling into dust. The dust began to swirl in a circle around Kaia, as a ferocious wind built up into a raging storm. In the eye of the storm, Kaia stood staring at the remnants of an extinguished world. When lightning shot out of storm and struck Kaia, she screamed, not in pain, but in anger. With the loss of an entire civilization weighing down on her, Kaia fell to her knees. She began to sink down as the Martian dust started to consume her like quicksand. The electric shocks that wracked her body seemed insignificant compared to the genocide of her people. There was nothing she could to save them. They had all died thousands of years ago. Sata reached down into the dust and tried to pull Kaia out. Despite Sata’s best efforts, Kaia slid further down into a dark abyss of despair. Instinctively, Kaia took one last gulp of air before her head was covered. Unimpeded by the dust, the electricity had no trouble finding her. After her grip on Sata’s hand slipped, Kaia became completely surround by dust. Two meters below the surface, Kaia became very still as she gave in to the crushing weight of her destroyed world. Kaia, get up. Your initiation rite is still ongoing. Kaia, please stand up. Listen, you were right all along, Kaia. My name is Nara. I was tasked with narrating your story after Ryt was recycled. Please, Kaia, don't give in. Ryt told me that he loved you like the daughter he could never have. He said he did not regret anything and that the time he spent with you was worth being recycled. I think I am beginning to understand how he felt. Ryt wouldn't have wanted you to die like this and I don't either. You need to breathe, Kaia. You need to survive. Remembering Ryt, Kaia began to struggle against the dust. Yes, Kaia, you can do it! Clawing her way back up to surface, Kaia emerged and took a deep breath. Ryt had been Kaia’s friend since she was a baby, long before she even met Sata. Kaia started talking later than most toddlers, because she became accustomed to communicating with Ryt using her thoughts. In fact, Kaia often became frustrated that no one else could hear her thoughts or understand her as well as Ryt could. Ryt had explained to Kaia that she was the only one who could hear narration and that she should keep her gift hidden. Kaia learned at very early age that her gift was not entirely positive. Whenever she was around other people, Kaia would hear their narrators in addition to her own. It was worst when large groups of people were talking. The voices of the narrators and people would blend together and make it difficult for Kaia to understand what anyone was saying. Sitting in the packed bleachers surrounded by chattering students had been hell for Kaia. It was all she could do to focus on Sata’s voice over the din of narration and chatter. Through the swirling dust storm, Kaia began to see the pulsing red warning light of of the TaserTutor and the glint of the metallic tendrils wrapped around her arms. Another shock from the tendrils caused Kaia to spasm and she hit her head on the TaserTutor. Sata appeared again at Kaia’s side and helped her stand up. Kaia propped herself on the TaserTutor and looked down at the console. There was no way to stop the initiation rite once it had begun and breaking free from the tendrils was impossible. The automated voice continued providing instructions, but Kaia was no longer paying attention. The initiation ceremony seemed so insignificant when compared to the destruction of Mars. Kaia just wanted it to end. As the TaserTutor once again begun to pulse red, Kaia used the virtual keyboard to skip the current task. The resulting electric shock only added to the fury that Kaia felt. Kaia, skipping tasks is not a good idea. Shut up, I don’t care. I just want this to be over. As soon as she could control her fingers again, Kaia began skipping task after task, pushing through each subsequent electric shock. Her ears were ringing. Tears were streaming down her face. Her breathing was hoarse and uneven. The burning smell was suffocating. Her mouth tasted as if her tongue was coated with metal. Rage was the only thing keeping her going. Even after the console stopped responding and the tendrils began to unwrap from around her arms, Kaia kept trying to skip. Kaia, the rite is done. You need to look behind you. Leaning against the TaserTutor for support and still focused on the console, Kaia was an easy target for the ChaseChimpanzee charging towards her. The ChaseChimpanzee tackled Kaia into TaserTutor so hard that she bounced off and ended up sprawled on the floor. A GuardGorilla lumbered up to Kaia, grabbed her by an ankle, and proceeded to drag her out of the gymnasium. As she was dragged past the bleachers, Kaia searched for Sata in the sea of students. The automated voice was already calling the next student up to the TaserTutor. Sata pushed through the densely packed crowd of students, leapt off the bleachers, and ran towards Kaia. When she was a steps away from Kaia, a nearby GuardGorilla grabbed Sata by her shirt and plucked her off the ground. Simultaneously kicking and punching the GuardGorilla, Sata fought to break free. Reaching her hand out to Sata, Kaia tried to say her name, but the sound that came out was nothing more than a pitiful moan. Suspended in the air, Sata prepared for a daring escape by bracing her legs against the GuardGorilla that was carrying her and gripping both sides of the neckline of her shirt. As she tore her shirt down the middle, Sata pushed off the GuardGorilla like a Olympic swimmer completing a flip turn. Angling her arms backwards to slide out of the shirt sleeves, Sata landed flat on her chest. Sata’s brassiere was pink, like her shirt, but a thin band of red underneath. The brassiere’s cups were decorated with decapitated heads of manga catgirls which were dripping blood onto the brassiere’s glittering red underband and vomiting rainbows to create the brassiere’s straps and wings. Crawling on her hands and knees, Sata made it to Kaia and grabbed her outstretched hand. Seemingly perplexed by the situation, the GuardGorilla paused for a moment, looking at the torn pink shirt in its hand. Still holding the ripped remains of Sata’s shirt with one hand, the GuardGorilla grabbed Sata’s foot with the other other hand and tried to pull the two friends apart. As the GuardGorillas yanked from both ends, Sata held on to Kaia’s hands with all her strength. When Sata’s shoe came off, Kaia and Sata hit the ground, Kaia on her back, Sata on her chest, but they remained linked. The GuardGorilla holding Sata’s shirt and shoe, looked back and forth between the two items. Its programming had not prepared it for this kind of situation. The shoe in the GuardGorilla’s hand was a ballerina flat decorated with manga catgirl heads bobbing in a rainbow vomit sea of their own creation. The GuardGorilla holding Kaia’s ankle seemed to grow impatient and began to drag the daisy chain of girls out of the gymnasium. “At least now, I won’t have to go through the initiation rite,” Sata joked. Despite the direness of her situation, Kaia smiled. Sata was so brave and strong, always looking out for Kaia and trying to cheer her up. Sata’s grin stretched across her broad face and lit up Kaia’s entire world. Thinking of how wonderful Sata was, Kaia’s eyes began to well up. Seeing that her friend was beginning to cry, Sata tried to strike a jovial tone. “Was this best plan you could come up with?” Kaia almost snorted with laughter. “It’s better than the one with the BuzzBees and WakeupWasps.” “Yeah, I hate bugs.” Sata laughed at her own joke and Kaia’s heart melted. Even being dragged shirtless through a college they would likely soon be expelled from, Sata was defiant and beautiful. Wishing she could pull Sata closer, Kaia became overwhelmed with emotion and broke down crying. Sata wanted to comfort Kaia, to reach out wipe the tears from her cheeks. “Cheer up, at least we’re helping to clean to the floor. Maybe we found our calling? I can be a broom and you can be a mop!” When Kaia continued to cry, Sata decided to double down. “Okay, okay, you can be the broom and I’ll be the mop. Is that better?” Kaia huffed, pretending to be exasperated. Sata took it as good sign. “Admit it. I’m funny! This is the standup comedy show that will redefine the word ‘standup’. Pretty soon every comedian will do shows while being dragged through the venue.” Kaia rolled her eyes. Sata beamed, knowing that her strategy was working. “Did you hear the one about the GuardGorilla, the HistorianHummingbird, and BuzzBee?” Kaia decided to join in. “I got a better one. A ChaseChimpanzee, a SurveillanceSloth, and a MessengerMeerkat walk into a bar…” Sata grinned triumphantly. “There you go! Maybe we can form a comedy duo? We’ll get dragged through all the best places in town!” When they arrived at the Provost’s office, the GuardGorilla let go of Kaia’s foot and opened the door. Sata helped Kaia to her feet, put Kaia’s arm around her shoulder, and walked with her towards the office. Leaning against her friend, Kaia became overwhelmed by the intoxicating scent of Sata’s bushy, unruly hair and almost fell over. As they entered the office, they saw the blue-green haired protester sitting in a chair with a GuardGorilla standing behind her. The protester was wearing a black shirt with ‘Smash the system!’ written on it and a design of a hammer smashing a machine and sending broken cogs flying in all directions. In the opposite side of the room was a large, well-polished mahogany desk. The college Provost was sitting behind the desk. He was snoring loudly with his head tilted back, his mouth open, his face and neck covered in BuzzBees, and drool flowing down the side of his chin and onto his blazer. The protester’s narrow face was swollen and covered with bruises. It was clear that she did not go quietly when the SecuritySimians took her. Her eyes, partially blocked by her wavy blue-green hair, widen when she saw Kaia and Sata approach. The look on the protester’s bruised face made Kaia wonder what she and Sata looked like. Sata, shirtless and missing a shoe, was supporting Kaia, whose hair was still standing on end from being electrocuted repeatedly. The GuardGorilla pulled up a pair of chairs for Kaia and Sata. Sata pretended to be puzzled by the gesture. “A brute with good manners? A brutish gentleman?” As soon as she helped Kaia sit down in the chair closest to door, Sata crossed her arms in front of her exposed chest and sat down in the chair in between Kaia and the protester. Turning towards the protester, Sata tried to start a conversation. “I think what you did in the gym was awesome!” The protester seemed unmoved by the compliment. “What the hell happened to you?” Sata took a deep breath and explained in a constant stream of words. “Kaia was really worried about the initiation rite, but then when it began she was doing really well, but then she stopped doing the tasks, and she got fried several times, and then she started skipping the rest of the tasks, and she got fried a bunch more times, and then the SecuritySimians got her. I tried to rescue her, but they got me too and brought us both here.” When the protester did not respond, Sata caught her breath and continued. “My name is Sata. My friend is Kaia. What’s your name?” “Fera.” Sata remained friendly in the face of Fera’s obvious indifference. “Hi Fera! Nice to meet you. I’d shake your hand, but my hands are full.” Sata looked down at her arms, still crossed in front of her chest over her pink brassiere. “Very full!” Sata exclaimed as she wiggled her shoulders and smiled suggestively at Fera. “Can one of you give me a hand?” Sata said looking back and forth between Fera and Kaia. “I think I’m more woman than any one person can handle.” “Is she always like this?” Fera asked looking at Kaia. Kaia shook her head. Her frazzled hair swayed from side to side. “Not always. I think she is just happy she got to skip the initiation rite.” “Kaia got herself fried so I wouldn’t have to go through it,” Sata said proudly. “How did you smuggle in that thing that made your voice really loud?” Sata asked Fera. “The gigaphone? I didn’t smuggle it in. I built it inside the gym from pieces of broken robotic animals.” “Where did you get the tools from?” “I built the tools I needed from pieces of broken robotic animals.” Pre-empting the next question, Fera responded before Sata could ask. “Don’t ask me where I got the tools to build the tools I needed to build the gigaphone.” Sata decided to ask a different question. “Can you teach me to build things?” “I’d only teach you if you were part of the revolution.” “The revolution?” “The revolution is a movement that will overthrow the government and build a better world.” “How are we going to do that?” “Anyway we can! The system of oppression that forces us to-” As if on cue, the Provost woke up noisily, send BuzzBees flying in every direction. Disoriented and disconcerted, he looked back and forth between the three girls in his office. Unsure of what to do, the Provost began to tap at the console on his desk and mumble to himself. Whenever he looked up, it was always at Sata’s chest. His gaze made her so uncomfortable, Sata shrunk back into her chair and curled up in a ball, bringing her knees up to her chin and wrapping her arms around her shins. “Don’t put your shoes on my furniture!” the Provost barked angrily. “What happened to your other shoe? And what happened to your shirt?” he asked disapprovingly. Kaia watched helplessly as Sata slipped into a seizure. Luckily, Sata stayed in fetal position in the chair even though her hands floated to her sides. “Never mind, I’m pulling up the recordings,” he said, losing patience quickly. Images of the initiation ceremony showed up on the walls of the Provost’s office. Kaia shuddered when she saw herself being repeatedly electrocuted. The visions that had been so powerful during her initiation rite now seemed so distant and foreign. She saw that Sata tried to go to Kaia after the first few electric shocks, but a ChaseChimpanzee pulled her back to her seat on the bleachers. Everyone in the room winced when they saw Kaia get tackled by a ChaseChimpanzee into the TaserTutor. The Provost seemed to be enjoying the show. When Sata’s shirt was ripped off, he bounced in his chair with glee. After the recording ended, he cleared his throat and put on a serious face. “The crimes you have committed are very serious. Disruption of the peace, unsanctioned protest, destruction of college property, indecent exposure, resisting arrest, assault with a deadly weapon-” “What weapon?!” Sata exclaimed incredulously. “Gigaphones are classified as lethal weapons. And rightly so, they can produce sounds 1000 times louder than regular megaphones. If it had been a weapon of mass destruction like a teraphone, I could have called in a strike team and had you executed on the spot!” The Provost’s eyes returned to the screen on his desk. “The EternalEnlightened have reviewed the video evidence related to your case. The results of your trial should be available any-” “Possible mitigating circumstances?!” the Provost exclaimed, interrupting himself. The Provost turned to Kaia. “The EternalEnlightened have asked for more information about your interaction with the TaserTutor. Why did you skip so many tasks? Did you suffer a psychotic break? Or were you making a statement against corporeal punishment in the education system?” Surprised to suddenly become the center of attention, Kaia felt her cheeks become flushed with embarrassment. She understood the reasoning behind the question. The college had access to all of her medical records, including her diagnoses. Kaia looked back and forth between Sata and Fera. She wanted to be defiant and strong like they were. She did not want mental illness to be the reason she got into this mess. She wanted to be normal. Kaia, I know what you're considering. Just tell them the truth. “It was a protest,” Kaia lied. Sata gasped. Fera nodded approvingly. “Did you conspire with the other two girls to stage the protest?” the Provost asked reading the question off the screen. “I planned my protest all on my own. Sata had nothing to do with it, she’s innocent!” The Provost huffed. “She is hardly innocent. Indecent exposure, interruption of a government-mandated ceremony, and interference with the arrest of a protester are serious crimes.” “Sata didn’t plan for any of that to happen. She was just trying to help me.” The Provost turned towards Sata. “Is it true that you had no idea about the protest plans and were not trying to make a political statement?” Still using her legs to shield herself from the prying eyes of the Provost, Sata nodded, her chin bouncing against her knees. Turning to Fera, “Did you conspire with the other girls to stage a protest?” the Provost asked. “I never even met them until you brought them in here!” Fera exclaimed. “We have the results!” the Provost shouted and then read the verdicts and sentences one after another. “Feravikadela Fridzia, you are found guilty of all charges and are sentenced to four years in juvenile detention.” “Kaiakeilaila Erkadia, you are found guilty of all charges and are sentenced to three years in juvenile detention.” “Satalitastra Azymuta, you are found guilty of all charges and are sentenced to one year in juvenile detention.” “Well, our college careers are really off to a great start,” Sata said somberly. The Provost continued to read. “Your sentences can be suspended and you can be allowed to begin your college studies if you all complete the initiation rite this afternoon, perform community service throughout your time in college, and sign a statement disavowing all previous political statements and activities. You each can each agree or disagree to the sentence suspension terms, but you must make your final decision before leaving this office.” “We should all agree,” Kaia said quickly, looking at the other two girls. “I’m not going to agree to anything,” Fera replied dourly. Kaia made the sweetest face she could, complete with a quivering lip and puppy-dog-eyes. “If you go to prison, we’ll never see you again! If you stay… maybe we can be friends?” Fera remained adamant. “I don’t want friends, I want to smash the system!” “You can’t start a revolution from inside prison,” Sata said. Fera crossed her arms. “I don’t care. I stand by what I did.” While Sata kept trying to convince Fera, Kaia closed her eyes and fell back into her chair feeling defeated. Kaia, ask the Provost for advice. Why are you suddenly trying to help to me? I tried to help you during the ceremony and I haven't been terminated yet, so I think it should be safe as long as I destroy all of the evidence afterwards. Ok, but why should I ask the Provost for advice? He doesn’t seem to be on our side. I don’t think he is going to give us good advice. His advice might convince Fera to do the opposite of what he suggests. Why do you want to help Fera? If Fera goes to prison, you are likely to feel terrible for a long time, and your prolonged depression would be super boring to narrate. “Provost Naiksos, what do you think we should do?” Kaia asked in a sweet and innocent voice. The Provost had zoned out and was tapping listlessly on his desk console. He looked up from the console and seemed to be very confused. Kaia elaborated, trying to sound even sweeter and more innocent. “What decision do you think we should make? Should we accept or refuse the terms?” The Provost cleared his throat again and became very serious. “I would encourage you to not compromise your deeply held political beliefs. It is very likely you would all end up in prison anyway, so refusing the sentence suspension terms would save everyone a great deal of time and effort.” “Thank you,” Kaia said, “we appreciate your advice, but I think we’re all going to agree to the terms.” The Provost had the impression that Kaia was not listening. “Accepting the terms will be extremely bothersome for everyone. First, we would have to deal with the disavowal statements. Then, you all will have to go through the initiation ceremony before the end of today, search for community service opportunities, and complete the required community service hours in addition to your studies.” “That honestly sounds better than going to prison,” Sata said. The Provost glowered disapprovingly at Sata. “If you accept the terms, I can assure you that college will be a living hell for you. Given the events that occurred today, it is almost certain that you will be ostracized by your peers and targeted by bullies. It won’t be too long before you will be wishing for the peace and quiet of the penal system.” “Why are you trying so hard to convince us to refuse?” Fera asked. The Provost tried his best to sound benevolent. “Your chances of success in college are close to non-existent and your chances of finding employment after college are even lower. Even if you do everything perfectly, you will still end up in prison sooner or later after prolonged unemployment. The automatic background checks will always point employers to the recordings from the initiation ceremony today. Do you really think anyone would want to hire you after seeing what happened?” The Provost replayed the recordings of the ceremony on the walls of his office. “I’ve seen countless students go through this college, and I can always predict which students will end up in prison. Well, since the vast majority of public college students end up in the penal system, I would be correct most of the time even if I blindly guessed that everyone would go to prison. Nevertheless, you can trust me, by accepting the terms you will only be setting yourselves up for disappointment.” “It’s better to try and fail, then to never try at all,” Sata said. The Provost shook his head. “I disagree. The penal system is really not as bad as you seem to believe. Plenty of people go to prison voluntarily to avoid the perils of a life in poverty. In prison, you will be guaranteed ample food, water, heat, and oxygen, as long as you work. I hear weightlessness is great fun and the views are majestic. After a few years in prison, you will become physiologically adapted to space and you will not even want to return to Earth.” “If it’s so great, why don’t you go?” Fera asked sarcastically. The Provost cleared his throat nervously. “I am needed here. My sacred duty of molding young minds is of utmost importance. Of course, I also cannot abandon my dear son Dun.” The Provost called up an image of a young man flexing his muscles and sticking out his tongue. “That’s the guy who was heckling us during the ceremony!” Sata exclaimed. “He is quite the precocious young man,” the Provost said fondly. “If your son were in our situation, would you recommend that he enter the penal system too?” Kaia asked. “Of course not!” the Provost shouted, turning red and getting flustered. “Dunik has a bright future ahead of him! I would never send him to rot in that-” The Provost stopped when he realized that he was hurting his own argument. “Still want reject the terms, Fera?” Kaia asked. “He wants you to refuse, so he can send you to prison and not have to deal with you! Are you just going to give him what he wants?” “Fine, I’ll accept, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to be friends with you two losers.” “I can tell we’re going to get along swimmingly,” Sata quipped. “We are ready to sign the statements,” Kaia said to the Provost, trying to move things along before Fera had a chance to change her mind. “I truly believe you are making a mistake,” the Provost said shaking his head. Seeing that the girls were were not going to change their minds, the Provost sighed and brought up three copies of the disavowal statement on the desk, one in front of each girl. “Go ahead and sign, but don’t come complaining to me when you inevitably fail.” The three girls started scrolling through statements, carefully reading each word. Fera finished reading first. “Why can’t we-” “The statement text is non-negotiable,” the Provost said sharply, cutting Fera off. Kaia spoke up next. “I don’t under-” “If your families could afford attorneys, they would have paid into your student accounts. It is not my job to explain legalese to you. I told you that accepting the terms was going to be a huge burden on everyone!” After going over the statement again, Kaia placed her hands on the desk and leaned her face over the desk, signing the statement with the scans of hands and face. A few moments later, Sata did the same. When Sata placed her hands on the table and leaned forward, the Provost froze with his eyes open wide and his mouth ajar as gawked at Sata. As soon as her statement was signed, Sata jumped back into the chair curled up in a ball again. Sata and Kaia turned their attention to Fera, who was staring at the statement with clenched fists. When Fera noticed the other two girls looking at her, she exploded. “This is bull-” “Just sign it already, so we can get out of here,” Sata pleaded. Fera slammed her palms on the desk to sign the statement and leaned over the table. Fera sat back down, but then shot back up again immediately and proceeded to kick the desk repeatedly. “That’s real mahogany!” the Provost lamented. “Come on, help me with Kaia,” Sata said pulling Fera with one hand and covering herself with the other hand. As soon as Sata got up from her chair, the Provost became entranced and soon forgot about any damage that his desk might have sustained. Exiting the Provost’s office required a team effort. With Sata trying to cover herself, it was up to Fera to open the door. As soon as they made it past the door, they were greeted by a familiar voice. “Hey guys, who ordered the lesbo sandwich with butch bread?” A group of boys started laughing and exchanging high-fives in front of the office door. The boy had been waiting for the three girls to exit. The girls recognized that the boy speaking to them was Dun. “If you play your cards right, I might add some of my special sauce to your crappy sandwich.” The boys went berserk with laughter. “You had all that time since the ceremony and that was the best you could come up with?” Fera fired back. Looking over at Sata, Kaia noticed that her friend was having another seizure. Kaia watched powerlessly as the hand that was covering Sata’s chest drifted down in the front of her. “Look fellas, this one is ready for me,” Dun said as he moved forward with his hands reaching out towards Sata’s chest. Fera swung at Dun with her free hand, while kicking him in the shins. Kaia tried to pull Sata back away from Dun, but was too weak to move Sata very far. Kaia opened her mouth to scream for help, but before she could make a sound, a HistorianHummingbird crashed into the side of Dun’s face, sending him crashing to the floor. Fera gave Dun one more kick before pulling the other two girls through the semicircle of stunned boys. After Sata recovered, she was dazed and confused, but she understood that they needed to run. Kaia’s feet could barely keep from dragging on the ground while the two taller girls carried her down the hallway. “Let’s head to the theater,” Fera said. “It’s dark inside and there are plenty of places to hide.” Once inside the theater, the girls got up on the stage and hid behind the curtains, trying to catch their breath. They were all tired, but still very much on-edge. They all jumped when they noticed a set of four glowing eyes, in the same configuration as the eyes of a brown recluse spider, staring at the them. A sweet voice rang out from the darkness. “Sorry to startle you. No one ever comes to visit us. Please wait one moment while we turn on the lights. You might want to cover your eyes until they adjust,” said the sweet voice. When the lights came on, the girls saw a boy and girl, dressed in matching black jumpsuits. The boy seemed very awkward and reserved, while the girl carried herself with confidence. They both had dark hair and were roughly the same height. It was clear that they were twins. “Welcome to the theater!” the girl proclaimed with a flourish. Placing a hand on her chest, the girl introduced herself. “My name is Arla,” then gesturing towards her brother, “and this is Raf.” Arla curtsied and the Raf bowed. “What the hell are you?” Fera asked sharply. “Apologies, I’m not sure what you mean,” the girl replied. “Your eyes were glowing in the dark,” Sata explained. “And you looked like a spider,” Kaia added. “I can assure you that we are not spiders,” Arla said with a smile. “Why do your eyes glow in the dark?” Fera persisted. “I think you were seeing things. Sometimes when people are afraid of the dark, their minds play tricks on them.”, Arla replied. “Cut the crap. We all saw it.” Fera said, advancing menacingly towards the girl. “You’re Lunkers, aren’t you? If you try to lie to us-” “You mustn’t tell anyone anything!” the girl exclaimed. “It makes sense that Lunkers would want to work in a dark theater. It must remind you of home,” Sata offered. “Explain the spider eyes,” Fera said letting go of Kaia and holding up two fingers on each hand next to her eyes. After realizing what Fera meant, the Arla and Raf put their arms around each other and tilted their heads together. “We walk together like this because it enhances our night vision,” the girl explained. “You two look really cute together,” Sata said, smiling at them warmly. “Ha, I think the night vision enhancement isn’t the only reason they can’t keep their hands off of each other,” Fera said laughing. Arla and Raf separated, looking very embarrassed. “We are brother and sister!” the boy blurted out. Fera did not relent. “Oh, you two are naughty! Is incest normal for Lunkers?” “Stop it, Fera,” Kaia said, kicking her weakly. Sata tried to salvage the situation by introducing herself and the other girls. “I’m Sata, this is Kaia, and next to her is Fera. Nice to meet you both. I’d shake your hands, but my hands are full.” Sata opened her mouth to deliver the punchline, but Fera cut her off. “Don’t say it,” Fera warned. “Do you want me to lend you a shirt from the theater?” Arla said to Sata. Sata nodded emphatically. Arla smiled at Sata warmly. “Come with me to the dressing room so you can try a few things on.” Sata looked at Kaia with concern. “Kaia is hurt, do you have a place she can rest?” “Yeah, I would love to not have to lug this loser around anymore,” Fera added. “She’s pretty heavy for such a pipsqueak.” “Yes, there is, but you mustn’t tell anyone anything,” Arla said. “We get the idea,” Fera said flatly, “We’re not going to tell anyone anything.” Arla seemed relieved. “Ok, Raf and I built a secret bed so we could take naps in the theater during breaks from work.” During the awkward silence that followed, Kaia saw Sata was tempted to make a joke but held back. Unlike Sata, Fera could not resist. “You have a secret bed? That you built yourselves? So you could sleep together? Is that a normal thing for Lunkers?” Fera asked smiling mischievously. Raf was so embarrassed, he started to stammer. Fera did not relent. “How long have you been sleeping together? Is the sleep still good? Are you doing anything to spice it up? Trying out a new pillow, maybe?” Kaia was furious. “They’re trying to help us and you keep bullying them!” Arla tried to diffuse the situation. “We saw the recording of the ceremony today. We think you are all very brave. We went through the rite two years ago. It was horrible.” Raf approached Fera shyly. “I thought the gigaphone you built was great. I like making things too.” Arla came up with a plan. “Raf, you can tell Fera and Kaia about your tinkering on the way to the secret bed, and I’ll take Sata to the dressing room.” Fera waited until Sata and Arla were out of earshot. “Have you built anything special recently? Maybe a device to help your sister sleep? Something to knock her out so you can knock her up!” “Stop it!” Kaia yelled. Fera continued to mock Raf brutally. “When you sleep together, does she snore really loud? Do you have to cover her mouth to keep the whole college from hearing?” “That’s enough!” Kaia yelled pushing Fera away. Not having the strength to stand on her own, Kaia fell to her knees. Fera was not done yet. “Kaia, are you sure you even want to lay down in the secret bed? It must be covered with sleep stains!” Kaia began to cry, feeling powerless to stop Fera. “When’s the last time you cleaned the sheets? Wait, have you ever cleaned the sheets? I bet we can find the secret bed just by the smell!” Fera said, pinching her nose with a look of disgust on her face. Raf helped Kaia to her feet and started walking with her in the direction of the secret bed. Fera continued after them, not letting up even a bit. “Have you ever been this close to a girl who wasn’t your sister? Be careful, Raf, your sister might get jealous! She’s used to having you all to herself, she might not like sharing you with Kaia.” Fera continued to taunt Raf all the way to secret bed. Sata and Arla were already there waiting for them. “What took you so long? I was worried,” Sata said. Kaia didn’t respond, she just looked angrily at Fera. Sensing the tension, Sata tried to change the subject. “How do I look?”, Sata asked. Sata twirled around and struck a pose. She was wearing a long flowing shirt covered by an elegant bodice. The sight of Sata took Kaia’s breath away. “Like a GuardGorilla in a milk maid outfit,” Fera answered. “What is it with you?” Kaia screamed pushing off of Raf and lunging at Fera. Fera stepped out of the way effortlessly. Kaia stumbled and fell, landing on her hands and knees. “Looks like I hit a nerve! I’ve been making fun of Raf for ages without much of a response. Then, I say one harmless thing about Sata and Kaia flips out. Sorry Raf, looks like Kaia only cares about Sata, I guess you are stuck with your sister for now.” Kaia could not hear Fera anymore over the howling wind tearing through the theater. Sifting through the dust on the floor with her fingers, Kaia pulled out assorted fragments of bone and shook them in her hand like dice. Through the dust swirling around Kaia, she saw the metallic glint of the TaserTutor. The metallic tendrils extending from TaserTutor were coiled around her arms up to the shoulder. The ceremony was still ongoing. The TaserTutor began to pulse red. Kaia’s heart sunk. Had she imagined everything? Fera, the Provost, Dun, Raf, Arla? Lightning shot out of the surrounding storm and coursed through Kaia’s body. Kaia screamed and writhed on the ground, but then got up with a renewed sense of purpose. Did she have a chance to change the future? If she answered the remaining questions, could she turn everything around? Kaia knew what she had to do. She would continue through the initiation rite, deny any political motivations, blame everything on her mental illness, and do anything else necessary to keep Sata safe, even if it meant that Fera would go to prison for years. Kaia began to feverishly work on the problem displayed on the console. She nearly finished with the task when the tendrils started restricting her movements and moving up past her shoulder. The tendrils wrapped her neck and around her head. She braced her legs against the TaserTutor and pushed as hard as she could, trying to break free of the tendrils. New tendrils extended out of TaserTutor wrapping around her legs. Before long, Kaia was encased head to toe in tendrils. The tendrils constricted, wringing all of the moisture out of her body. When the final drop of blood disappeared in the swirling dust below, Kaia had been squeezed dry and her mummification was complete. Roving the desolate wasteland of Mars, Kaia was the Dust Goddess, a vengeful spirit in search of her next victim. She hunted the new invaders, the ones who desecrated the remains of her people in search of riches. When the invaders began to arrive with greater frequency, she raised an army of the dead to repel them. Sitting victorious atop her throne, she waited for the next opportunity to fertilize the barren soil of Mars with the blood of her enemies. This is was her fate. This is how she would remain forever. In a perpetual cycle of death and waiting, Kaia would protect the memory of her lost civilization from each new crop of fools who sought to strike gold on the red planet. Disturbed by an unfamiliar sensation on her forehead, the Dust Goddess let out her anger in a roar that shook the ground. After probing her face with an tendril-covered hand, she was stunned to see that her fingers were moist. Without even a drop of blood in her for millennia, the Dust Goddess was dessicated to the core. Where had the moisture come from? Tiny drops of water were falling down on the her face wherever she went. How could there be rain on Mars? She looked up and saw the constellations rearranging into a face that filled the heavens. The Dust Goddess recognized the face in the stars. It was Sata. The raindrops were coming from her eyes. “Come back to me, please,” the sky whispered. It was no use. The Dust Goddess was not going to spring back to life from a few drops of water! The sky sighed and began to squeeze the horizons until the land where the Dust Goddess stood disappeared completely and the Dust Goddess was left floating in the void. The constellations warped and stretched until they gathered into a single brilliant ball of light. The ball of light grew arms, legs, and a head, taking the form of Sata. Reaching her hand out to the Dust Goddess, Sata drew closer and the tendrils began to break apart, revealing the dried out cadaver underneath. “Kaia, I need you,” Sata said. Yes, the Dust Goddess thought, that was once my name. In a past life? Or a future one? The light began to burn away her parched skin and brittle bones. Beneath it all, a dim flicker of light began to shine. Could it still be revived? Sata cupped her hands around the flicker and blew into it gently. Each time Sata blew into her hands, the flicker grew stronger, eventually growing into a flame. As Sata drew in breath, Kaia reached out from inside the flame and gently touched the sides of Sata’s face. When Sata leaned in to blow on the flame again, Kaia pulled her in and kissed her on the lips, sucking her life-giving breath deep into her lungs. Kaia’s body convulsed on the hard concrete floor of the theater. She was hyperventilating, in a panic. Sata lifted Kaia’s head up off the ground and cradled it in her arms. She smoothed Kaia’s hair with one hand and supported Kaia’s neck with the other. Soon the convulsions were replaced by shivers and Kaia’s eyes began to focus on Sata’s face. Kaia saw Sata’s face become blank as a seizure took her. Still trembling, Kaia looked up at Sata, studying her face intently, waiting for Sata to come back. When Sata returned and saw Kaia looking up at her, tears sprung anew from Sata’s eyes and bathed Kaia’s face. “Is she alive?” Fera asked impatiently. “Yes, no thanks to you,” Sata replied sharply. “Let’s get her into bed,” Arla said. Kaia was underwater in a sea of tears, looking up at Sata in the stars above. An eight-eyed octopus obscured the view of the sky and Kaia tried to shoo it away, but it extended four pairs of tentacles towards Kaia and carried her with to onto a tuft of seaweed. Kaia suddenly felt very grateful to the octopus. She gazed deeply into as many of its eyes as could. Reaching out her hands, she began to caress its tentacles. The tentacles began to reciprocate. Kaia was blissfully exchanging caresses with the octopus when she had a startling thought. “If I’m underwater, how is it that I’m breathing?” Kaia shot up, throwing the tentacles off of her and gasping for air. “It’s OK, Kaia,” Sata said reassuringly. “You’re safe now.” Sata laid down next to Kaia in the bed, cradling Kaia in her arms. Kaia buried her face in Sata’s shirt just above the bodice. The smell of the starchy shirt mixing with Sata’s scent was heavenly. Soon, Kaia stopped trembling and her body relaxed. Kaia lifted her face up to look at Sata. Sata was so radiant and lovely that Kaia began to cry. Sata leaned in and kissed Kaia’s cheeks, catching the fresh tears with her lips. Kaia fell asleep with a smile on her face as Sata slowly showered her with kisses. The blissful look on Kaia’s face warmed Sata’s heart. They were together. They were safe, at least for now. The world melted away. Sata did not realize how exhausted she was until now. With one arm still around Kaia, Sata tugged futilely at the bindings of her bodice. “Let me help you,” Arla said as she swooped in to deftly undo the bindings of the bodice and pull it out from under Sata. This kind gesture surprised Sata so much that she began to cry. Through the tears, Sata looked at Arla with gratitude. “Don’t cry,” Arla said, unfastening and removing Sata’s heels and then pulling up the blankets to cover Kaia and Sata, “You’re safe here, and I’ll stay and watch over you.” Unable to recall anyone other than Kaia being kind to her, Sata let out a sob. Afraid she had said something wrong, Arla stepped backwards. “I’m going to turn off the lights.” As the theater descended into darkness, Sata snuggled up to Kaia, greedily interlacing their legs and pulling Kaia closer with her arms. Recalling how Kaia often breathed in deep when they hugged, Sata rested her nose on top of Kaia’s head and filled her lungs with the scent of Kaia’s hair. The darkness around Sata exploded with a kaleidoscope of shimmering colors. With another breath, Sata began to float in between the colors as they gently twinkled around her. By the third breath, Sata was in another plane of existence entirely, slowly drifting off to sleep in the arms of her lifelong best friend. The Japanese word for catgirl is nekomusume↩︎ Kawaii is the Japanese word for cute↩︎ "],["productive-first-day.html", "2 Productive first day", " 2 Productive first day Why am I like this?, Fera thought as she covered her mouth so no one would hear her crying. She had been drifting in and out of sleep on the hard concrete floor of the theater, but she could not stop thinking of Kaia writhing on the ground during her psychotic episode. The screams were bad, but the low dull wailing that followed was somehow worse. It was as if Kaia had a demon inside her trying to claw its way out. Sata held onto Kaia the whole time, having seizures one after another. During the seizures, Sata’s eyes stayed open, the look of concern on her face would melt away, and she would stare off into void. When Kaia stopped breathing, Sata responded immediately by giving her CPR. Did Sata already know what to do, because she had been in this situation before? Fera felt absolutely powerless. She had never met anyone like Sata and Kaia. Was she responsible for what happened? It’s not my fault that they’re like that, Fera thought to herself, getting up off the ground. Looking at Kaia and Sata lying peacefully in the secret bed, Fera felt the urge to lay down in the secret bed next to them. The bed looked really nice, but Fera was wracked by feelings of guilt and did not feel she deserved to be comfortable. I don’t need sleep. Beds are for the weak. The only thing that matters is the revolution, Fera thought as she got up and started trying to find her way out of the theater in complete darkness. With each step, she probed the ground beneath her. She had not gotten very far when she noticed two glowing eyes observing her in the darkness. “Do you know you’re creepy as hell?” Fera asked. “Yes, I am aware of that. I am still learning how to interact with topsiders. My sister is much better. She is a people person,” Raf answered. “Well, then bring her here. I’d rather talk to her.” “She is watching over Sata and Kaia. If they wake up in the darkness-” “Shut up, turn on a flashlight, and show me the way out of here.” Raf complied immediately. “Would you like to see the maker workshop?” Is he still trying to be friends with me? Fera thought. What a loser! Not having other plans, Fera nodded. The maker workshop would be a welcome distraction from the feelings she was trying to ignore. Fera and Raf walked in silence to the maker workshop. Raf gave Fera a tour. Fera was dumbstruck at how technologically advanced and well stocked the maker workshop was. “I wasn’t expecting this place to be halfway decent. Everything else in the crappy college is absolutely worthless.” “Ben and Edl’s family finances the maker workshop but do not provide funding for any other part of the college.” “Who are Ben and Edl?” “They’re my friends. Ben is really smart. Edl is really big and strong.” Fera laughed. “And they have money to burn on all of this?” “Their parents are high ranking members of the CorporateCouncil.” “If they’re so rich, why do they go to a run-down public college?” “I don’t know, but you can ask them yourself.” Raf said walking up to a workstation and activating its console. After tapping a few times at the console, Raf stopped. “There’s a message for you, Fera. It says all of the consoles in the workshop will be blocked until you read it.” “How is that possible?” Fera asked. “I’m not sure. Ben might know, but I can’t call him while the consoles are blocked,” Raf answered. “Can you give me a few minutes to read it in private?” Fera asked. “Oh, of course. Just let me know when you are done,” Raf said before pulling a bin out of a nearby cabinet and going to tinker at a workstation on the other side of the workshop. Fera eyed the console suspiciously. The message had no metadata. No sender, no subject, no date, no time. The console was locked and Fera was the only one who could unlock it. The whole thing looked like a trap. Fera unlocked the console and immediately deleted the message. A new message appeared. Unlike the first message, the second message had a subject. The subject read “12 tips for a successful revolution that actually work.” Fera deleted the new message. Soon enough, there was a third message. This time, the subject was “The last guide to overthrowing the government you’ll ever need!” Fera was about to delete the third message when she received yet another message. The fourth message’s subject read “You won’t believe what’s in the printer to your left!” Fera deleted both messages, but then looked over at the printer. She carefully opened the printer compartment. There was a pair of eyeglasses inside. Overwhelmed by curiosity, Fera inspected the glasses. Along the inside of the frames, near the hinges, there were tiny openings for lasers which displayed information that was only visible on the inside of the glasses. Some text appeared that almost made Fera drop the glasses. The text read, “Hello Fera.” Fera looked around. The workshop was empty except for Raf and he was busy tinkering. The words, “Liberty, Equality, Sorority” appeared on the glasses. Someone was clearly trying to appeal to her revolutionary sentiments. Fera picked up the glasses and brought them over to the workstation where Raf was tinkering. “Move,” Fera said shoving Raf to side. She unscrewed the hinges and cracked open the temples. “Did you make these?” Raf asked. “Don’t ask dumb questions,” Fera snapped. The temples contained a laser array, a microphone, and a bone conduction sound system. Not finding anything nefarious, Fera put the glasses back together and put them on. Fera heard a soft, feminine voice say, Hello Fera. Looking around, Fera confirmed that she and Raf were the only people in the workshop. “Fera, did you finish reading the message? Should I call Ben and Edl now?” Raf asked. “You can call them using a console outside the workshop, right?” Fera asked. “While you do that, I will finish up with the message.” Raf seemed puzzled, but left the workshop without asking any further questions. Fera waited until Raf was gone before asking, “Who the hell are you and what the hell do you want?” My name is Unoa. I want to help you overthrow the government. “What’s in it for you?” Just like you, I'm not happy with the status quo. I want to see things change for the better. “Why the glasses? Why not talk to me in person?” We don't know if we can trust each other yet. “So how do you propose we build mutual trust?” First, let me prove that I can be useful. I can provide information and neutralize threats, like the bully you encountered earlier today. “Did you make the bird hit that guy in the head?” Yes, I made it look like a temporary flight path glitch to avoid suspicion. “Cracking the skulls of people who bother me is a great way to gain my trust.” I will protect you whenever necessary, but I would prefer to maintain a low profile for now. Speaking of which, Raf is returning and it would be best if he did not hear you speaking to me. Raf walked up to Fera and announced, “Ben and Edl are on the way.” “That’s great, Raf,” Fera said while scrolling through information about the maker workshop on the console on the workstation where Raf had been working. The glasses provided additional details on whatever Fera was reading. “I see the consoles are unblocked. Did you find out anything about the message?” “What? Oh, the message was just a boring system-generated announcement sent by the college,” Fera lied. Good one, Unoa said approvingly. “OK, do you want to see what I was working on?” Raf asked. Fera nodded without looking up for the console. Raf prepared a demonstration. “It’s a robot that builds birdhouses out of gourds like this one.” Raf removed a gourd from his bin and placed it on the table next to his robot. “First, the robot drills a hole into the gourd. Next, it hollows out the gourd and buries the seeds so more gourds can grow. Finally, it hangs the gourd up on a tree.” The robot finished drilling a hole in the gourd and started scooping out the contents of the gourd onto the workstation. Raf proudly observed the robot work. Not wanting burst his bubble, Fera pretended to pay attention, but she could not imagine anything more boring that a birdhouse building bot. Unoa clearly agreed. There's nothing even remotely interesting about this robot. Initiating display of epic fail videos. Fera tried to keep a straight face while her glasses displayed recordings of people falling down and/or getting hit by various objects. Luckily, Fera did not have to feign interest for long. Ben zipped into the maker shop on powerskates. Wearing a white lab coat over a vest, dress shirt, and tie, Ben did not seem to fit the skater archetype. The lab coat flapped behind him like a cape. His lab coat and dress shirt sleeves were rolled up past a pair of metallic gloves that extended up to Ben’s elbows. Coming to sliding stop in front of Fera and Raf, Ben bowed deeply and said, “Welcome to the maker shop! I’m Ben, and this is my little brother Edl.” Fera thought that Ben might have been joking when he referred to Edl as his ‘little brother’. Edl was more than twice as tall as Ben, who would have been shorter than Fera if not for the additional centimeters provided by his powerskates. Moreover, Edl looked like he could wrestle a GuardGorilla and win. He was wearing a BugBall jersey and shorts that seemed to be specially designed to fit his large frame. The glasses displayed information on Ben and Edl. They may be useful for the revolution, but be careful. History has repeatedly shown that the ultra-wealthy are often counter-revolutionary, Unoa warned. “This is Fera,” Raf said. “She likes making things too!” “The gigaphone you built was impressive, considering the limited resources you had at your disposal,” Ben said. “Just think of what you could build in the maker workshop!” “I can use all this stuff?” Fera asked. “Yes, of course!” Ben said sweeping a begloved hand across the workshop, “You can use any free workstation you like,” then turning towards a console, “You can also reserve any workstation for any period of time,” then holding up one finger on one hand, “But you can only reserve one workstation at a time.” Fera glanced at the console screen. “The reservation schedule looks mostly empty. Actually, you and Raf are the only ones making reservations. Do people mostly use whatever workstation is available?” Ben looked a little uncomfortable. “The workshop is criminally underutilized. The college does not require anyone to use it and it seems that making things is not everyone’s cup of tea. Also, there is a harmful stereotype that makers are socially awkward nerds, but nothing could be further from the truth. I welcome social interaction! In fact, I hold biweekly maker interest group (MIG) meetings that are open to everyone. Neverthless, despite my best efforts in promoting the MIG, attendance remains limited.” “If you come to the meetings, we can have…” Edl looked around the workshop to confirm that his calculations were correct. “Four people!” “Maybe more people would show up if you made the meetings secret and exclusive,” Fera suggested. “People like being part of inside groups.” Ben began to scribble notes on his palm with his finger. “That’s brilliant!” Looking up from his palm, “Would you like to be the first member of our newly formed secret maker interest group?” “Sure,” Fera replied casually. “Excellent!” Ben responded and then opened a large cabinet. “You can use any of the tools as long as you follow the workshop rules.” “What are the rules?” Ben brought up an image on the wall that said, ‘MACHINE WORKSHOP RULES’ 1. Do not intentionally kill, maim, or otherwise injury any sentient, living creature. “Is there only one rule?” “Yes, at least until we can agree on additional rules to add.” “What about stealing?” “Every item in the workshop has a tracker and everything in the entire college is recorded, so I don’t think a rule against stealing will be necessary. If a MIG member steals anything, we will know and can revoke their access immediately.” “What about destruction of property?” “Property can be replaced. Sometimes property gets destroyed during testing of new inventions. I do not think protection of property should be a priority. Again, if a MIG member acts maliciously, we can always revoke their access.” “What about college rules?” “The MIG has full autonomy from the college. We are entirely self-governing.” “Sounds like you can do whatever you want.” “Well, yes, within reason. As the MIG Founder and President, I rarely exercise my executive powers. We put most decisions to vote.” Fera took a moment to savor the idea of being able to do whatever she wanted. Fera noticed a container labeled Ben’s Builder Bots. “You’re building builder bots?” “Yes, though I prefer to call it metabuilding,” Ben said pulling out the container to show Fera. Fera studied the contents of the container. “Can the builder bots build builder bots?” Ben opened his mouth to answer, but then started to scribble furiously on his palm while muttering to himself. “Builder bot building builder bots… Self-replication… Metametabuilding… Why build when I can metabuild? Why metabuild when I can metametabuild? Brilliant!” Then looking up, Ben asked, “Would you like to be Vice President of the MIG?” “You don’t already have a Vice President?” Fera asked looking at Raf and Edl. “Edl and Raf said they are happy being Treasurer and Recordkeeper, respectively.” “I look at the money go out,” Edl said proudly. Fera furrowed her brow. “MIG financial management is completely automated and budget is practically unlimited,” Ben explained. “What would I do as Vice President?” “You would represent the MIG, and if the President is indisposed, you would exercise your executive powers,” Ben said solemnly. “How would I exercise my executive powers?” “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. First, we would have to vote you in a vice president. Do you want to run? Even though you’ll be running unopposed, we still have to vote.” “Ok, sure,” Fera said, trying her best to sound indifferent. Raf walked up to console to enter a summary of the vote. “Excellent, with all current members present, we have quorum. All those in favor of Fera becoming Vice President of the MIG?” Raf, Edl, and Ben all raised their hands, said “Aye!”, and then all looked at Fera. When Fera realized that they were waiting for her, she raised her hand and said, “Aye.” “Alright, all opposed?” Ben asked, waiting for a few moments for anyone to object. Fera opened her mouth to say something, but decided against it. “The vote is unanimous. Congratulations! We will hold elections again at the end of the academic year. If you like, you can run for President.” “You don’t want to be President anymore?” Fera asked. “I am a senior this year, so I cannot run again. Even if I could, it would be wise to start preparing the next generation of MIG leadership,” Ben said. “If you run for President next year, I will vote for you,” Raf said. “You have my vote too,” Edl added. Ben nodded. “Yes, I plan to vote for you as well. As the current Vice President and very likely future President of the MIG, you should learn about our executive powers. If something were to happen to me, you have to be ready to step in and take over. Without the guardianship of the MIG, the college would quickly descend into chaos,” Ben said. He walked over to a printer, entered a complex series of key presses, and laid his hands down on the screen. “Take off your shoes, have a seat, and put your hands and feet into the scanner please.” “What? Why?” Fera asked. “I am going to make you a pair of PresidentialPowergloves and a pair of PresidentialPowerskates, like the ones I have, but I need have the exact scans of your hands and feet,” Ben replied. Fera sat down in front of the printer and slid her hands and into the scanner. “You do know how to skate, right?” Ben asked suddenly, realizing he should have ascertained this important detail earlier. Fera nodded. Skating was Fera’s refuge. She learned to build things by fixing and upgrading her skates. She would skate everyday until late in the night, skipping dinner and only coming home to avoid sleeping on the street. The only time she felt safe at home, was when her father was asleep. Sometimes her father would wake up angry. Most of time, that anger would spill over onto her mother, but sometimes her father would wake Fera up to yell at her and hit her. There were a few times when he did not even wake Fera up and just started hitting her while she was still sleeping in bed. If anyone asked about the bruises that covered her body, Fera would say that fell down while skating. The truth was that skating was much safer than being at home. “While the printer is printing your gloves and skates, I can show you how they work,” Ben said, then he noticed that Fera had not moved since she sat down. “Fera, the scanner is done. You can pull your hands and feet out now.” Fera retrieved her hands and feet from the scanner and turned her attention to Ben. “The skates provide a top-level security clearance, so you can go anywhere in the college and the AnimalAutomatons will not try to stop you. To speed up, press your big toe down, to slow down lift your big toe, but be careful if you lift it to high, you will start going backwards. To turn very quickly, lower one big toe and raise the other. To activate magnetism, curl all of your toes. Magnetism is most useful for tight turns, but you can also skate on any wall that has a high metal content, which is most of the walls in the college. Do you have any questions?” Fera shook her head. “The skates are really intuitive. I am sure you will get the hang of them quickly. The gloves are a bit more complex. First of all, the gloves can open any door in the college, you just have to place a hand on it. You can also control any AnimalAutomaton in the college. To provide a command, speak clearly and use gestures. The gloves also accept commands in sign language, but you can do almost everything with verbal commands.” “I know sign language,” Fera said. Ben looked shocked. “My mother was deaf for a long time before she got the implant. She taught me sign language, because she said that I couldn’t really know her without learning her native language,” Fera explained. In the mornings, while her father was still asleep, Fera and her mother spoke in complete silence using sign language. Fera would have her bag packed, hours before she needed to leave for school. If she heard her father waking up, Fera would grab her bag and run out the door. The mornings when her father would sleep in were the best. Fera would sign with her mother for as long as she could. Her mother would tell her stories while Fera wolfed down food after skipping dinner the day before. When her mother’s stories would make Fera laugh, Fera had to cover her mouth so that her laughter would not wake her father. “Fera, are you listening?” Even though her mother took the brunt of the abuse, Fera was secretly jealous of her mother. When her father would start yelling, her mother could deactivate her implant and pretend she was still listening. Fera wished she could turn off her hearing or at least turn off her memory. Fera would cover her ears, but she couldn’t close her ears the way she could close her eyes. Instead, she had to absorb all of the yelling, often for many hours. Every horrible thing her father said remained burned in her memory. Fera, Ben is waiting for you to respond. “Yes, sorry, you were saying?” “The gloves have a range of a few hundred meters and if you ever find yourself further away than that, you should be able to close the distance quickly with the skates. Each glove can also deliver a powerful non-lethal electric shock, but the shock should only be used in emergencies, because the shock completely drains the glove fuel cells. The electric shocks are only for an emergency, do you understand?” When Fera first got her period, her mother showed her a hidden bag filled with supplies and explained the emergency plan. If Fera’s father ever tried to take off Fera’s clothes or took his clothes off in front of her, Fera was supposed to grab the hidden bag, run out the door, and never come back. Ben could tell that Fera’s thoughts were elsewhere. “Fera, maybe you want to sit down and take a break?” “No, I don’t need a break.” Fera saw that the printer had finished. “I’m ready to try out the gloves and skates.” “Ok, but let me know if you need to rest for a bit.” “I’m fine,” Fera said sharply. She opened the lid of the printer and put on the skates and the gloves. “Now, you’ll want to take it slow at first-”, Ben started. Fera whizzed up to a GuardGorilla watching over the maker workshop and started signing at it furiously. The GuardGorilla hopped onto its hands and started to dance upside-down. Fera called three ChaseChimps over and made them cannonball one by one onto the feet of the GuardGorilla. Ben, Raf, and Edl looked in on in amazement as the GuardGorilla started to juggle the ChaseChimps with its feet. Fera turned towards a wall and with a few signs had a swarm of BuzzBees and wakeupWasps hovering in front of her. She had the swarm form different shapes in the air and then sent all of the robotic bugs back to their nests. I suppose you won't have much need for me anymore now that you have your fancy gloves. “Ok, I think I’m getting the hang of this,” Fera said stopping right in front of the three stunned boys. Ben cleared his throat. “It appears you have a natural affinity to the skates and gloves. I believe you are ready to begin learning the Ancient martial art of DroneDarting.” “DroneDarting?” “Yes, that’s what it’s called until we can agree on a better name.”, Ben said unfurling a worn scroll with hand-drawn images and intricate hand-written text. “This ancient scroll holds the long-forgotten secrets of the DroneDarters of the distant past.” Studying the scroll, Fera noticed something strange. “Ben, is that your name at the bottom there?” Ben looked embarrassed. “Yes, it is.” “Did you make DroneDarting up?” “Well, it is a real martial art, but yes, I did invent it.” “How is it ancient if you invented it?” “Sorry, you’re right. It just sounds better if a martial art is ancient. I was thinking that no one is going to care about a martial art developed by a teenager.” “You might be right. Let me see that scroll,” Fera said starting to take the scroll from Ben. “Be careful with that, it’s ancient!” Ben exclaimed. Fera looked at him sternly. “You’re right. It is not ancient. I burnt the edges and then poured tea all over it,” Ben said, surrendering the scroll to Fera. Fera looked at the scroll intensely. “It’s very convincing. If it weren’t for the signature, I might not have figured it out right away. The idea is to send flying AnimalAutomatons into your opponents?” “Yes, any AnimalAutomatons can be used, but birds have the right combination of speed and mass.” He's right. I guess great minds think alike. Fera used her gloves to summon two HistorianHummingbirds. “En garde,” she said, looking menacingly at Ben. “To be honest, I don’t think you are ready for sparing. We should start with some kata. Here, I can-” Fera sent her two birds flying at Ben’s head from two different angles. Ben pivoted to avoid the birds, lost control of his powerskates, and landed on the ground. Fera had the birds land on Ben’s chest. “Do you yield?” she asked triumphantly. “Yes, yes!” Ben said quickly. Fera helped him to his feet. “Do you want to go again?” Fera asked innocently. “No, no, I think that’s enough for today.” “Hold on, these gloves are extremely powerful. Is there some kind of fail-safe? Some limit to their power?” “A fail safe? That’s an interesting idea. The gloves are tailored to their specific wearer, so they could not be used by anyone else.” “If you wanted to turn off someone else’s gloves, would you be able to?” “Yes, I would need to access a console to deactivate a pair of gloves.” “Can you show me?” Fera asked sweetly. “Of course!” Ben said, expertly gliding up to a console. “First, you need to find the user. Then you can see all of their permissions. For example, you have-” Ben stopped mid-sentence and then asked, “It appears that you already know how to modify permissions since you added your glasses to your user profile.” “Do changes take effect right away or do you have to confirm them?” Fera asked moving up to the console. “They take effect immediately, so please be careful!” Fera adjusted the position of multiple icons. “Did I do it right?” “Yes, that’s amazing. You deactivated my gloves and skates on the first try!” “And if I pull up two users, I can transfer permissions between them?” “Yes, that’s correct. Just move the icons. Yes, just like that. I knew the interface I designed was intuitive, but I never thought anyone would be able to figure it out without any explanation. I guess my user interface design skills are better than I suspected,” Ben said proudly. “Um, Fera, you seem to be locking me out of the system. Could you please restore my permissions? Also, I think we should discuss the permissions that you enabled for yourself. This is still your first day in the MIG and as far as I understand your first day in college, so maybe we should take things one step-” “It’s been a crazy first day so far,” Fera said still tapping at the console. “I made great new friends and found a place where I truly feel I belong. Thank you for accepting me into your group and making me feel welcome. I couldn’t have asked for better friends,” Fera said, turning to face the boys. Ben grabbed his chest overcome with emotion, almost falling off of his deactivated powerskates. Raf and Edl both held onto each other for support, wiping tears from their eyes. All three boys looked at Fera with admiration and affection and were caught completely off guard by swarm of BuzzBees Fera sent after them. On her way out of the workshop, Fera commanded the ChaseChimps and the GuardGorilla to keep the boys in the workshop. Fera sped down the hallway towards the Provost’s office, but she turned around when she heard a fierce battle cry behind her. It was Edl, covered in BuzzBees, sprinting toward her. Fera started to command every AnimalAutomaton in the hallway to attack Edl. Edl slowed down as the AnimalAutomatons began to pile on. Before going around the corner, Fera saw Edl under a mountain of AnimalAutomatons, valiantly trying to fight them all off. Fera, this is not conducive to maintaining a low profile. Fera burst into the Provost’s office and ordered the AnimalAutomatons inside to stand down. “Here’s what’s going to happen, you sack of-”, Fera stopped when she saw that the Provost was sleeping in his usual position, head tilted back and mouth opened. Jumping on top of the desk, Fera kicked the Provost in his face until he woke up. Placing one of her powerskates on his chest and lunging forward as if she were stretching her psoas muscle, Fera leaned in and looked at the Provost menacingly. “I want a full pardon for me and the other girls.” The Provost looked back and forth between Fera and the powerskate on his chest. Then, the Provost opened his mouth to speak, but instead vomited all over Fera’s powerskate. Fera recoiled in disgust, then she instinctively kicked the Provost in the face repeatedly, sending specks of vomit flying in all directions. “Get the pardons! For me, Kaia, and Sata.” “I don’t haf that aufority!” “Then you better find someone who does or I’m going to powerskate all over face while the GuardGorillas hold you down.” “You’re bluffing.” Fera signaled to the GuardGorillas to take the Provost to ground. She jumped down from the desk and lowered the vomit-covered powerskate towards the Provost’s face. When Fera activated the powerskate, it sprayed the Provost with his own vomit. Whenever Fera touched the powerskate to the Provost’s face, her leg would fly forward as she were kicking an invisible foe. “Shtop, Shtop, please. I’ll requesht the pardonsh!” “Oh, you’re no fun.”, Fera said as she commanded the GuardGorillas to put the Provost back in his chair. The Provost cleared his throat, wiped his face with the sleeve of his blazer, and started entering the pardon requests as Fera stood over him making sure he did not try any tricks. The pardon requests were approved soon after the Provost submitted them. Fera commanded the GuardGorillas to hold the Provost by his arms before hopping off the desk to read carefully through each one of the pardons. Fera, I can replace the recordings of you, Kaia, and Sata with deep fakes that show you all doing really well in the initiation ceremony. “Great! In the meantime, I’m going to see what else I can do with the Provost’s console. Fire alarm. Sprinklers. Deactivate all AnimalAutomatons. Self-destruct?” “No, not the shelf-deshtruct!” The Provost’s alarmed face was all the encouragement Fera needed. She laughed as she started the self-destruct sequence. An automated voice began to count down in reverse, second by second, starting from 10 kiloseconds. “We haf to leaf now,” the Provost pleaded. “The shelf-deshtruct-” “We’ll go when I’m ready,” Fera said. “But, the-” Fera commanded one of the GuardGorilla to cover the Provost’s mouth. Fera had no intention of leaving until she was certain no one would try to deactivate the self-destruct sequence. To kill time, she watched the deep fake initiation ceremony recordings Unoa had created and made sure the original recordings were overwritten. Then, she checked that the college had been completely evacuated. A full review of the college video feeds showed that every room was empty, including the maker workshop. When she was satisfied that no one was coming to storm the Provost’s office, Fera had the GuardGorillas carry the Provost out of the office. On her way out of the office, Fera nearly fell over over. The powerskate covered in the Provost’s vomit was not working at all. When Fera looked out into the hallway, she was surprised to see Raf there waiting for her. “I thought we were friends…” Raf said. “But you are not acting like a friend.” “What are you doing here, Raf? Have you been waiting here this entire time?” “Why do you want to blow up the college, Fera?” “I’m going to overthrow the government, starting with this college!” “The government is not nice to Lunkers. They search our cities for precious minerals with blindingly bright lights. If they find anything, we have to move our people to avoid the drilling machines.” “In the new world we are going to build, there will be justice for everyone, even Lunkers.” “If I can help my people by joining your revolution, then I am happy to do so, but I’m not sure how blowing up the college will help anyone.” “I don’t have time to explain it to you. Come on, let’s get out of here.” “Please wait a moment,” Raf said with eyes closed. “What the hell are you doing? Snap out of it,” Fera said grabbing his shoulders and shaking him. “I’m creating a diversion,” Raf replied. “How? By growing roots? By making food from the sunlight like a plant?” “How did you know I can grow roots and photosynthesize?” Raf asked opening his eyes wide in shock. When Raf realized that Fera did not know about his plant-like abilities until he gave them away, he got flustered. “You mustn’t tell anyone anything!” Raf exclaimed. The hallway was suddenly filled with sound and movement as a thick mass of birds flew in through the holes in the walls. Raf pulled Fera down and shielded her from the birds with his body. Fera freed her arms from out under Raf and signalled to every nearby robotic bird, bat, and bee to fight the avian invaders. “Did you do this?” Fera asked over the sound of the birds clashing with the AnimalAutomatons. Raf nodded. “I am sorry, Fera, but my diversion worked. I think you are really amazing, but I can’t let you to blow up the college.” “Get off me, Raf, I’m not your sister!” “I have to protect you from the birds.” “You’re enjoying this, you creep!” Fera placed her functional powerskate on the ground and activated it. The powerskate pulled Fera out far enough from under Raf that she was able to wriggle free. Staying low to the ground to avoid the overhead, Fera prodded Raf. Emerging from the cloud of flying creatures, Edl scooped Fera up, pushed her against the wall, and placed his hands on her shoulders to keep her immobilized. “Let me go!” Fera screamed, kicking and flailing her arms futilely. “We can’t let you go until you stop the self-destruct sequence,” Ben said walking along the wall while shielding himself from aerial assault with two umbrellas. Ben closed one of the umbrellas and stood next to Fera. Edl leaned forward and create a protective arch with his body, insulating Ben and Fera from the battling birds, bats, and bees. “Hello again Fera, could you please deactivate the self-destruct system?” Ben asked politely. “No,” Fera said defiantly, signaling to the GuardGorillas to attack Ben and Edl. “I disabled the GuardGorillas while you was distracted by the birds. If you continue to refuse, I’m afraid that I will have to shock you,” Ben said. He brought the tips of closed umbrellas closed. It crackled with electricity. “You can take that umbrella and shove it up your-” Fera was interrupted by the shock. “I really hate to have to insist, but I am still locked out of the system. Are you open to deactivating the self-destruct system now?” “No, but maybe one more shock will do the trick,” Fera said with a demonic smile. Ben sighed and brought the umbrellas in for another shock. This time, Fera took hold of the umbrella and pulled Ben in. With her other hand, Fera grabbed Ben’s wrist and shocked him with her powerglove. As soon as he saw Ben crumple to the floor, Edl burst into tears, picked up his brother, and cradled him in his arms. Moving around Edl, Fera saw that aerial battle had mostly come to an end. The hallway was filled with rubble, destroyed AnimalAutomatons, and dead birds. Raf was on his knees and crying. “You’re crying too?! Again?! You’re all a bunch of crybabies!” Fera yelled. In between sobs and rocking back and forth, Raf said, “They’re dead. You killed them.” “I didn’t kill anyone!” Fera yelled. Raf opened his hands to reveal a dead bird and then went back to hugging it to his chest as he cried. “You mean the birds?!” Fera screamed, suddenly feeling full of rage. TODO: Add back deleted Raf text here … She started kicking Raf as hard as she could. Fera kept kicking even after Raf fell over. When one leg got tired, Fera switched to the other leg. After her rage dissipated, Fera remembered the impending destruction of the college. She tried to pick Raf up, but he was completely limp. Fera pulled the flashlight out of Raf’s pocket and used it to shine a light on Edl. “Come on Edl, you have to carry Ben and Raf out of here.” To her surprise, Edl complied immediately. Putting Ben and Raf on his shoulders, Edl started trotting down the hallway. Fera was able to keep with Edl, but the Provost started to fall behind. “Don’t leaf me!” the Provost begged. “Lay down on the ground!” Fera barked at the Provost, who dropped to ground in an instant. Fera grabbed the Provost by the hand and started pulling him by the hand down the hallway. “Wait, where are you going? The main entrance is the other way,” Fera said. Edl stopped, deep in thought. He seem very nervous. “There are escape pods in the maker workshop,” Edl said shyly. “Enough for all of us?” Fera asked. “I don’t know,” Edl said, “Ben would know.” Edl looked over at his brother and started to cry again. “There’s no time for crying Edl!” Fera yelled shining the flashlight in Edl’s eyes to get his attention. “We have to get out of here!” Edl continued towards to the maker workshop. Once inside, Edl gently laid Ben and Raf down on workstations, while Fera analyzed the escape pod controls on a nearby console. Fera shuddered. There were only two escape pods and each could only fit one person. One of the escape pods was larger and had more fuel. Clearly, Ben had designed the escape pods for himself and his brother. Fera considered taking one of the escape pods for herself, but she knew that it would be a death sentence for the others. Ben and Raf were unconscious, Edl was helpless without guidance, and the Provost was in pharmacological stupor. “Edl, put Ben inside the pod on the left,” Fera said. “Great, now get in the other pod on the right.” “What about you?” Edl asked. “There’s another set of escape pods left for us,” Fera lied. “Are you sure?” Edl asked looking around. Fera had expended all of her patience. “Get in the damn pod!” Edl did not ask any further questions. The pods filled with liquid and a metal shield lowered in the it. A loud rumbling noise rolled through the workshop and the metal shield became red from the heat of the rocket ignition of the launching escape pods. “What about our eshcape pods?” the Provost asked. “There are no more pods,” Fera said flatly. … “Come on,” Fera yelled at the Provost as she took Raf’s arm and activated her the one powerskate that was still working. The Provost could not keep up. Fera gave the flashlight to the Provost, grabbed him and Raf by the hand, and started to pull them down the hallway, swiveling to avoid the rubble while balancing on her only working powerskate. Whenever Fera used the non-functioning powerskate to make a tight turn, she could feel the vomit squish inside. Once they were outside, Fera saw that everyone the area around the college had already been evacuated. Fera checked the tram station and saw that public transportation had been completely shutdown. She pulled up to a microtransit vending machine with the Provost and Raf in tow. Fera whipped the Provost toward the vending machine. “Unlock it!” “What are-” “If you don’t unlock it quick, we’re all going to die.” The Provost placed his palms on the machine and leaned in for the retinal scan. Fera made a selection using the accompanying display, and a black motocycle with a sidecar rolled up a ramp next to them. Fera zoomed up to the motorcycle. “Wait, don’t leaf me!” The Provost yelled reaching for Fera. “What do you think the sidecar is for?”, Fera answered as she started the motorcycle. Fera spun the motorcycle around and pulled up next to the Provost. The Provost lifted Raf onto the motorcycle in front of Fera and then climbed into the sidecar. Racing down the empty street, Fera tried to remember how much time was left when she still in the Provost’s office. She sped towards the direction where she had seen airships lifting off. When she reached the market square in the city center, Fera saw that the last airship was taking off. She drove right under the airship and let go of the handlebars to wave her arms above her head. The airship kept rising up into the air. They must have seen her. Why were they still moving upwards? Fera looked to the Provost for ideas on what to do next. The Provost retrieved a small case from the pocket of his blazer, pulled out all of the BuzzBees in the case, and placed them inside of his shirt. “How big is blast zone?” Fera asked Provost. “To the treesh!” the Provost answered. “What?” “We haf to get to the treesh,” the Provost replied, pointing off into the distance. Fera did not know where the Provost was pointing, she had never seen trees in the city. She suspected that she did not have enough time to make it out of the city, but she decided to enjoy the motorcycle while she could. As Fera accelerated down the street, she thought about what had happened that day. Fera had pushed back against the system and won. Even if she had only succeeded in smashing just a single cog in the machine of oppression, it was worth it. Reflecting on her life, Fera realized that for the first time, she had felt truly powerful. She was always powerless to stop her father from beating her when he got angry. Even worse, she could not do anything to protect her mother. Being in control, even if it was part of one day, was worth any cost. Even if she knew that she was going to die, she would not have changed much about today. She wished she could say goodbye to her mother and hug her one last time. She also would have liked to be able to apologize to Kaia and Sata. Maybe if things were different, they could’ve been friends? Fera’s eyes filled with tears. Fera thought about Ben, Edl, and the life she could have had working in the maker workshop. Maybe she could have also helped Arla and Raf in the theater? Fera looked down at Raf. He was still not moving. Fera kept one hand on the throttle and stroked Raf’s hair with the other. She began to cry harder. It’s the wind in my eyes, Fera thought, No way I’m crying over those losers. Fera closed her eyes. It didn’t matter now. She was free. She relaxed her body and focused on her last few breaths. The blow from behind came sooner than Fera expected. She thought she would hear the explosion first and maybe have a chance to look back at the blast before it enveloped her. As she flew through the air with her eyes closed, she stretched out her arms and imagined she was a bird flying over the empty city towards an infinite sea of green trees on the horizon. Ben and Edl looked out on the empty city from the observation deck of one of their family’s airships. “I hope Fera and Raf made it out OK,” Edl said. “I am sure she did. Fera is extremely cunning. I have never before met someone who I might consider my intellectual equal,” Ben said before adding, “no offense, Edl.” “Is Fera still going to be part of our group?” Edl asked. “As far as I can tell, she did not break any maker workshop rules. The city was safely evacuated and reconstruction will begin as soon as the rubble cools. To be frank, the MIG always felt incomplete when it was just you, me, and Raf.” “I am glad that Fera can be still in our group,” Edl said beaming. “Me too.” Ben said, patting Edl’s massive shoulder. “To be honest, we’ll be lucky to have her. On her first day in college, Fera built a gigaphone from stolen parts, became MIG Vice President, mastered droneDarting, defeated us in combat, and doomed the entire city. I’ve never heard of anyone having such a productive first day. The way she used the powergloves and powersk-” Ben snapped his fingers as he got an idea. “We can track Fera using the powergloves and powerskates.” Moving to a console, Ben brought up Fera’s location on a map. “She is still in the city.” “Can we pick her up?” Edl asked. “We wouldn’t make it in time.” The two brothers looked out the windows at the chain of explosions snaking through the city.
